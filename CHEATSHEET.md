## Basics · [01](01-simple-sql-statements/README.md)

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE products (
    name   VARCHAR(50),
    price  INTEGER
);

-- Insert rows (values match columns by position)
INSERT INTO products (name, price)
VALUES ('Notebook', 3), ('Desk Lamp', 40);

-- Read data
SELECT * FROM products;
SELECT name, price FROM products;

-- Calculated column + alias
SELECT name, price * 2 AS double_price FROM products;

-- Text
SELECT name || ' costs ' || price  AS label,
       CONCAT(name, '!')           AS excited,
       UPPER(name), LOWER(name), LENGTH(name)
FROM products;
```

**Remember:** text in `'single quotes'` · `7 / 2 = 3` (integer division) · `||` with `NULL` gives `NULL`, `CONCAT` skips it.

## Filtering · [02](02-filtering-records/README.md)

```sql
-- Comparison operators
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price > 40;
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price IS NULL;        -- never use = NULL or <> NULL

-- Ranges and lists
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 60;   -- inclusive both ends
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category IN ('Electronics', 'Stationery');
SELECT * FROM products WHERE category NOT IN ('Electronics');  -- avoid if the list/column can contain NULL

-- Combining conditions (AND binds tighter than OR — use parentheses!)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE (category = 'Home' OR category = 'Stationery') AND price < 5;

-- Calculations inside WHERE (can't reference a SELECT alias — repeat the expression)
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price * stock > 1300;

-- Change existing rows
UPDATE products SET stock = 25 WHERE name = 'Bluetooth Speaker' RETURNING *;

-- Remove rows for good
DELETE FROM products WHERE name = 'Sticky Notes' RETURNING *;
```

**Remember:** `WHERE` runs before `SELECT`, so it can't see column aliases · `NULL` is never `=` or `<>` anything, use `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` · a `NULL` inside a `NOT IN (...)` list silently zeroes out the whole result · always preview an `UPDATE`/`DELETE`'s `WHERE` with a plain `SELECT` first — there's no undo.
